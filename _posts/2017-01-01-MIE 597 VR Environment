## Description

This is a proof of concept environment designed as a tool for retailors to test store layouts and visualize sales data in virtual reality. It is meant to enable store managers to base layout decisions on data and visual appeal without physically moving furniture. The environment was created in Unity and the project centered around customizing controller interactions, user interfaces, and visual design.
