title:  "Senior Capstone: Prosthetic Golf Attachment"
layout: post
---

## Motivation
For individuals missing a hand or part of their upper limb, there is a severe lack of prosthetic solutions for swinging a golf club with proper form. The leading product on the market results in poor swing mechanics and discomfort to the user.

### Objective
To develop the first prosthetic golf attachment with a wrist joint to simulate the trailing wrist and hand, giving golfers with disabilities more control and power over their swing.

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
